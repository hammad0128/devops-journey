# Day 2 – Exploring More Linux Commands ⚡

Today I continued my DevOps learning journey with another solid study session. I spent time practicing more Linux commands and deepening my understanding of how files, directories, and commands interact inside the terminal.  

---

## 📌 What I Did
- Revised the basics from Day 1 (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `touch`, `mkdir`, etc.).
- Learned how to:
  - Move between directories with `cd ..` and `cd -`.
  - Create nested directories using `mkdir -p`.
  - Copy files (`cp`) and entire folders (`cp -r`).
  - Move/rename files with `mv`.
  - Remove files with `rm` and folders with `rm -r`.
- Practiced **pipes (`|`)** to combine commands.
- Used **redirection (`>`)** to save command output into files.
- Experimented with `grep` to filter out specific words inside a file.
- Explored command help with `whatis` and `man`.
- Used `history` and `ctrl+R` to quickly repeat old commands.

## 💭 Reflections
- I understood clearly that `cd` works only for directories, while files are opened or viewed with commands like `cat` or editors (e.g., `notepad.exe` in WSL).
- The combination of **pipes + grep** feels powerful, especially when searching logs or filtering file contents.
- Redirection (`>`) made me realize how easy it is to generate reports or save outputs for later use.
- It was interesting to see how Linux provides multiple ways to do the same thing — but some are more efficient.

## 👨‍🎓 About Me
Still in **5th semester of Computer Science**, I feel more confident today compared to Day 1. Each new command feels like a building block towards becoming comfortable with DevOps tools.

## 🎯 Conclusion
Day 2 was a step forward in becoming fluent with the Linux command line.  
I now feel more comfortable handling files, folders, and command history. Tomorrow, I plan to dive into **file permissions** and more advanced shell usage.
