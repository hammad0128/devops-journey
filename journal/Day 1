# Day 1 – Starting My DevOps Journey 🚀

Today marks the beginning of my DevOps learning path. I studied for around **4 hours**, mainly focusing on Linux basics.

## 📌 What I Did
- Set up **WSL** and installed **Ubuntu** successfully – it felt a bit tricky but really interesting.  
- Created my first **GitHub repo** (`devops-journey`).  
- Practiced and learned essential Linux commands:  
  `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `mkdir -p`, `cd ..`, `cd -`, `ls -R`, `cat`, `wc`, `whatis`, `man`, `history`, `ctrl+R`, `head`, `|` (pipes), `grep`, `>`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, `cp -r`, `rm -r`.

## 💭 Reflections
- The experience of setting up my environment and running commands for the first time was exciting.  
- I realized how powerful even basic Linux commands are when combined with pipes and redirection.  
- This gave me confidence that I’m moving in the right direction.  

## 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am a **5th semester Bachelor’s student in Computer Science**, and starting DevOps feels like an important step toward shaping my career.  

## 🎯 Conclusion
Overall, it was a productive and motivating start.  
I’m excited to continue this journey, learn step by step, and document everything along the way.
