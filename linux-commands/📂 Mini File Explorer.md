# Beginner DevOps Project ⭐

A beginner-friendly project that simulates a file explorer using only Linux commands.  
Instead of navigating with a GUI, this project organizes files and folders from the command line and adds automation with shell scripts.


## 🚀 Project Overview
- Created a structured directory system (`docs/`, `images/`, `scripts/`).
- Added dummy data in each folder (notes, reports, placeholder images, and scripts).

### - Practiced Linux basics:
  - File operations (`mkdir`, `touch`, `ls -R`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`)
  - Viewing & searching (`cat`, `head`, `wc`, `grep`)
  - Pipes & redirection (`|`, `>`)

### - Automated tasks with shell scripts:
  - `run.sh` → sets up a `backup/` folder
  - `backup.sh` → copies files into `backup/`

## 📂 Folder Structure
### 🛠️ How to Run

Make scripts executable
chmod +x projects/scripts/*.sh

Run project setup
./projects/scripts/run.sh

Run backup
./projects/scripts/backup.sh

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

This project demonstrates:
- Confidence with Linux command line
- File & directory management
- Automating tasks with shell scripts
- Real DevOps practices (backups, reports)

It’s a simple but powerful way to start working like a DevOps engineer 🚀
